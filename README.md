# Flow

## About Flow
Flow is a simple kanban board application to organize your to-dos and track your progress. With flow, you can add, delete, and update your to-dos and categorize them between *to-do, in progress,* and *done* by moving them across each provided columns. 

## How to Run Flow
Some functionalities of the JavaScript code may not run by simply opening **index.html**. If none of the Kanban Columns appear, please run on a local host or through **[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)** Extension on VSCode.
